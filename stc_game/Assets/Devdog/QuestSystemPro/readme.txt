1. Import the asset
2. All code and general usage documentation can be found at: http://devdog.io/unity-assets/quest-system-pro



General usage:

Once you've imported Quest System Pro into your project a new menu item will show up in your main menu bar. Tools / Quest System Pro / *
 

1. Creating the managers
	To initialize Quest System Pro you need to add the managers to your scene. 

	First, create a new object (name doesn't matter) and attach the following components to it:

	QuestManager
	DialogueManager
	AudioManager
	These 3 managers initialize the quest system and handle all events and so on. 

2. Setting the databases
	Next you'll need to add the databases to the QuestManager. There are 3 databases

	LanguageDatabase: Handles all language related things like messages that can be displayed to the user.
	SettingsDatabase: Contains all settings for your project including UI prefabs used in the UI.
	QuestDatabase: Contains all quests and achievements.
	
	When you've added the QuestManager you'll see a new button at the bottom of the inspector "Generate and link databases". When you click this a folder selection window will show up. Once you've selected a location to save the new databases they'll auto. be generated and added to your managers object.

	By default there are already databases available you can re-use. You can find these in the QuestSystemPro / Demos / Files / Databases folder.

3. Start creating quests
	All done, you can now create quests and add them to your project. Remember that every scene that uses quests or dialogoues needs to have the managers in that scene (you can use DontDestroyOnLoad).
